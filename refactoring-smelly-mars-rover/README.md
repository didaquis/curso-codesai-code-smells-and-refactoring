Smelly Mars Rover code refactoring (kata solved)
=============================================

Smelly Mars Rover code to practice refactoring.

We'll use it to learn to recognize some code smells
and to fix them applying some useful refactorings.

-------

This is a summary of the behavior of the rover that was implemented:
- It's located on a grid at some point with coordinates (x,y) and facing a direction encoded
  with a character.
- The meaning of each direction character is:
  * ``N`` -> North
  * ``S`` -> South
  * ``E`` -> East
  * ``W`` -> West
- The rover receives a sequence of commands (a string of characters) which are codified in
  the following way:
  * When it receives an ``f``, it moves forward one position in the direction it is facing.
  * When it receives a ``b``, it moves backward one position in the direction it is facing.
  * When it receives a ``l``, it turns left, changing its direction (by 90ยบ).
  * When it receives a ``r``, it turns right, changing its direction (by 90ยบ).
    
The initial code was created using TDD, but the coders unfortunately skipped the refactoring step of TDD.

For this reason, even though the code is fully tested and behaves as expected, it's full of communication and maintainability problems.
